psuedo:
1-- create bucket array of size of the constriants 
2-- this bucket array will contian the count of each number appearance in the main array
-- bucket[nums]++;
3-- sum the number of apearance of the number and the previous number to it
bucket[i] = bucket[i]+bucket[i-1] where i start with 1;
4-- create result array that with the size of original array 
and the index of the result will represent the number of the smallest numbers
resul[i] = buckets[nums[i]-1];
note that if nums[i]==0;
result[i] = 0; because no number less than 0;
